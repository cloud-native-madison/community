# Community Events

This folder contains resources from Cloud Native Madison events — past, present, and future!

Each event typically includes:

- Slide decks
- Event recaps
- Speaker info
- Photos
- Video links (if recorded)

New event folders follow this pattern:  
`YYYY-MM-event-name`

Example:  
`2025-06-june-circle`

We welcome community contributions — if you gave a talk and want to share your slides or links, open a PR!
